NativeUI
========

NativeUI is a Unity plugin for launching native views on top of the Unity Player. 
Currently only iOS is supported, but an Android equivalent will be added.

Special thanks to [Prime31](http://www.prime31.com) for the inspiration for this project. It is 
based on their original 
[NativeBinding](https://github.com/prime31/P31UnityAddOns/tree/faca2ae8a7f38374b8a93b8e7d828fcf979b9bda) 
code, but mostly re-written and updated for using storyboards.

This project contains sample projects for both a native Xcode app, and a Unity project 
which will embed the native app. There is also a Unity package containing the plugin assets.
